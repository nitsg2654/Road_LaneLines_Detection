### Reflection

1. My pipeline consisted of several key steps:

    * Grayscale Conversion: First, I converted the image to grayscale. This simplifies the image, as color information isn't necessary for detecting edges or lines.

    * Gaussian Smoothing: Next, I applied a Gaussian blur to the grayscale image. This step helps to remove noise and spurious gradients by smoothing the image, making edge detection more reliable.

    * Canny Edge Detection: After blurring, I used the Canny edge detector to identify strong edges in the image, which correspond to potential lane lines.

    * Region of Interest Selection: I defined a polygonal region of interest that roughly encompasses where the lane lines should appear. This masks out irrelevant parts of the image, like cars or the sky.

    * Hough Line Transform: I applied the Hough Line Transform to detect straight lines in the edge-detected image. This technique allows us to find lines in the form of mathematical equations from the pixel-based edge data.

In order to draw a single line for both the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function to compute the average slope and intercept of the lines on the left and right sides of the image. For each set of lines (left and right), I extrapolated the detected line segments to cover the full extent of the lane by averaging their slopes and intercepts, and then drawing the extended lines.

2. One potential shortcoming of the current pipeline is its sensitivity to different lighting conditions. If the image is too dark, too bright, or has shadows, the edge detection may not work reliably, leading to incorrect lane line detection.

Another shortcoming could be the pipeline's inability to handle curved or dashed lane lines effectively. The Hough transform works best with straight lines, and so the performance could degrade when applied to curvy roads or dashed lanes.

3. Possible improvements in pipeline:
A possible improvement would be to make the lane detection more robust to different lighting conditions by dynamically adjusting the thresholding parameters used in Canny edge detection. Incorporating image normalization or histogram equalization might help in handling varying lighting.

Another improvement could be to use a more sophisticated line-fitting algorithm to better detect and fit curved lines. Additionally, applying machine learning techniques to recognize lane line patterns could help handle various types of lane markings, including dashed and solid lines.
